# Optional: Model name, defaults to gpt-4o
OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-4o"
```

3. Generate Prisma Client:
```bash
npx prisma generate
```

4. Run migrations (when database is available):
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

5. Start development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Commands

### Database Management
```bash
npx prisma generate           # Generate Prisma client after schema changes
npx prisma migrate dev        # Create and apply database migrations
npx prisma studio            # Open Prisma Studio (database GUI)
```

### Build & Run
```bash
npm run dev                   # Start dev server with Turbopack
npm run build                 # Production build
npm start                     # Start production server
npm run lint                  # Run ESLint
```

## üéØ Core AI Features

### Skill Tree Generation (`/api/ai/generate-tree-stream`)
- **Input**: User goal, skill level, weekly hours, preferences
- **Output**: 15-25 skills with dependencies, difficulty ratings (1-10), XP rewards, learning resources
- **Streaming Mode**: Real-time progress updates via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
  - Shows token generation progress
  - Reports parsing and validation steps
  - Displays database save operations
- **Architecture**:
  - OpenAI streaming API with `stream: true`
  - Validates response with `SkillTreeResponseSchema` (Zod)
  - Saves generated trees to PostgreSQL with prerequisite relationships
  - Type-safe TypeScript output inferred from schema

### Task Evaluation (`/api/ai/evaluate-task`)
- **Input**: Task details, user submission, base XP
- **Output**: Quality score (1-10), adjusted XP, constructive feedback, improvement suggestions
- **Architecture**: Validates response with `TaskEvaluationSchema` (Zod)

**Benefits**:
- Type-safe responses (Zod infers TypeScript types from schemas)
- Reliable JSON parsing (OpenAI's structured outputs)
- Works with any OpenAI-compatible API (set `OPENAI_BASE_URL`)
